Analysis:

Domain:
1. Boat – represents a single boat with relevant details.
2. Fleet – a collection of boats with methods to manipulate and report on them.
3. CSVLoader – helper to load boat data from a CSV file.
4. Driver – class containing main() to run the program and interact with the user.

Function Points:

1. Boat:
   - Stores type (sailing/power), name, year, make/model, length in feet, purchase price, and expenses.
   - Calculates remaining budget for expenses.

2. Fleet:
   - Maintains a collection of Boat objects.
   - Adds or removes boats.
   - Finds boats by name (case-insensitive).
   - Prints fleet report with total purchase price and total expenses.
   - Supports saving and loading the fleet from persistent storage (FleetData.db).

3. CSVLoader:
   - Reads boat data from a CSV file and constructs Boat objects.
   - Adds boats to a new Fleet object.

4. Driver:
   - Uses Scanner to interact with the user (only place with keyboard input).
   - Presents menu options: Print, Add, Remove, Expense, Exit.
   - Handles user input and updates the Fleet accordingly.
   - Ensures expense validation before adding to a boat.

Scenarios:

1. Printing Fleet:
   - User selects P → prints detailed fleet report including individual boat info and totals.

2. Adding a Boat:
   - User selects A → enters new boat CSV data → boat added to fleet → confirmation message.

3. Removing a Boat:
   - User selects R → enters boat name → boat removed if exists → appropriate confirmation/error message.

4. Spending on a Boat:
   - User selects E → enters boat name → enters expense → adds expense if within budget → error if exceeds budget.

5. Exiting Program:
   - User selects X → fleet saved to file → program exits.

Design:

Classes and Objects:
1. Boat → myBoat objects
2. Fleet → myFleet object containing multiple Boat objects
3. CSVLoader → utility class (static methods) for loading fleets from CSV
4. Driver → main() program controller

Data:
1. Boat:
   - BoatType type
   - String name
   - int year
   - String makeModel
   - int lengthFeet
   - double purchasePrice
   - double expenses

2. Fleet:
   - List<Boat> boats

Methods:

1. Boat:
   - Constructor: initializes all fields
   - Getters for all attributes
   - canSpend(double amount) → checks if expenses can be added
   - addExpense(double amount) → increments expenses
   - remainingBudget() → returns remaining budget
   - toString() → returns formatted string of boat info

2. Fleet:
   - addBoat(Boat b)
   - removeBoat(String name)
   - findBoat(String name)
   - printFleet() → prints each boat and totals
   - load() → loads Fleet from persistent file
   - save(Fleet fleet) → saves Fleet to persistent file

3. CSVLoader:
   - loadFromCSV(String filename) → returns a Fleet loaded from CSV

4. Driver:
   - Presents menu
   - Reads input using Scanner
   - Calls appropriate methods on Fleet/Boat
   - Validates input (expense limits, existing boats, CSV format)
